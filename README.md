### Demo Instructions
Our application is designed for use with exclusively Google login to streamline the signup and login process. When the demo Google account cs3240.super@gmail.com signs in to the application, it will automatically be granted administrator permissions (not superuser). When any user submits a study space or activity, it must be verified by an admin using the verification tab. Admins have the ability to edit and delete study spaces and activities regardless of who created them. Regular users can only edit and delete their own study spaces and activities.
